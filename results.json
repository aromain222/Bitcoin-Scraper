    "description": "Bitcoin developer Ben Allen has received a $100,000 grant from investment firm Maelstrom to support the development of Payjoin, a privacy-focused tool aimed at improving Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and privacy. According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen\u2019s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy. Payjoin was first proposed by Nicolas Dorier in 2019 in Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 78. The core principle behind the system is that both senders and receivers may contribute inputs to a transaction. \u201cNamely that privacy is enhanced and improved consolidation of transaction outputs is achieved, benefiting scalability,\u201c the Maelstrom announcement states. A Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that grantees are paid monthly for a total of $100,000 per year in Bitcoin and Allen\u2019s grant will last one year. There are no concrete milestones and the grant is managed on a hands-off approach: \u201cWe believe grantees may work better with freedom to work on what they wish, rather than being tightly controlled by those who provide the funding.\u201c Related: Bitcoin privacy will survive despite CoinJoin closure \u2014 zkSNACKs CEO Payjoin: Soon in wallets near you? Allen will be working on improving Payjoin implementations, with the clear objective of making it possible for the feature to be added to more wallets. He explained that the funding will enable him to work on the project full time. The announcement points out that the system presents challenges, with the receiver needing to be online and the payment communication flow being more complex than normal non-interactive Bitcoin transactions. Maelstrom\u2019s chief investment officer and BitMEX crypto exchange co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes said that \u201cimproving financial privacy in Bitcoin is extremely important.\u201d He added: \u201cThe great thing about Payjoin is that if only a small amount of adoption is achieved, it breaks a key assumption used by financial surveillance companies. The assumption they have is that if a Bitcoin transaction has multiple inputs, all the inputs must all belong to the same entity.\u201c A Maelstrom representative explained to Cointelegraph that the firm \u201cis keen to support more grantees in the privacy area.\u201d The company is actively seeking candidates with strong track records in Bitcoin privacy projects. Related: What are privacy coins and how do they differ from Bitcoin? Enjoy the benefits whether you use it or not Hayes noted that \u201cPayjoin adoption improves the privacy of even the people who don\u2019t use it.\u201d Allen said he believes privacy is important for Bitcoin users to enjoy a better experience and control their financial data when using it daily. Allen told Cointelegraph he is \u201cbuilding out benchmarks to help downstream developers implement Payjoin in individual wallet software as well as expanding test coverage to ensure consistent and reproducible code.\u201d He explained that encouraging its adoption \u201cis the biggest step we can take for simplifying the experience and encouraging Payjoin adoption by moving the complexities mostly away from the user.\u201d The Maelstrom representative told Cointelegraph that \u201ca key metric for Payjoin success would be adoption by popular open source Bitcoin wallets.\u201d \u201cIn particular if the BitcoinCore wallet ever adopts it, that would be a huge signal of success,\u201d they added.

The funding will support Rkrux working full-time on Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin relies on voluntary developers to maintain its codebase as an open-source project. Maelstrom recently launched a grant program to encourage more full-time work on improving and contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s core infrastructure. The first recipient is Rkrux, an emerging Bitcoin Core reviewer who completed Chaincode Labs\u2019 FOSS program this year. The grant will enable Rkrux to quit his job and focus entirely on Bitcoin development. \u201cOne of the goals of the grant program is to recognize and reward emerging talent contributing to Bitcoin Core development,\u201d said Arthur Hayes, Maelstrom\u2019s CIO. Hayes added that supporting full-time developers strengthens the Bitcoin ecosystem. Rkrux represents the type of new talent Maelstrom hopes to back through its grants. Rkrux said the funding came at the perfect time as he was deciding whether to leave his job to pursue Bitcoin Core full-time. \u201cThe financial support from Maelstrom has made this possible,\u201d he remarked. As an experienced engineer but newer Bitcoin contributor, Rkrux is eager to step into the role and advance the project. He aims to become a top Bitcoin Core developer with Maelstrom\u2019s grant backing. The more full-time developers working on Bitcoin core, the better it is for the network\u2019s improvement and resilience over time.",

    "description": "BitMex's 100x Group has awarded its last Bitcoin development grant of the year. The company has awarded a grant valued at $40,000 to Calvin Kim for his Bitcoin scalability solution, Utreexo \u2014 a project originally created by Tadge Dryja from the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. Bitcoin's protocol checks every proposed transaction to make sure that the sender has enough coins to complete the request. All unspent Bitcoin (BTC) is saved in what is known as UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Outputs. While the entire Bitcoin blockchain is currently around 300 GB, the UTXO is only 4 GB. MIT researchers have claimed that as the network grows, this may one day present a bottleneck of its own. With Utreexo, the person holding the funds specified in a particular transaction maintains the full UTXO data themself, proving that the funds exist. When they want to spend coins from their wallet, they present proof of their validity in the form of a hash, which takes up a lot less space than the original data. This, in turn, makes the protocol more scalable without sacrificing security, according to the project's researchers. This solution is reminiscent of the \"fast catch up\" concept recently proposed by Algorand. It is worth noting, however, that Bitcoin purists tend to be skeptical of any scalability solutions that seek to replace full nodes with hashes or zero-knowledge proofs.",

Apply early and meet priority dates to have the best likelihood of being eligible for maximum funding each year. You must demonstrate financial need to be eligible for most assistance. Financial aid is designed to cover the gap between your own financial resources (savings, income, help from parents or guardians, etc.) and school expenses. Financial Aid can be grants, scholarships, low-interest loans, and student employment. Apply between October 1 and May 15 each year that you are enrolled at BTC. Please be sure to activate your BTC email. BTC Student Financial Resources correspondence will be sent to the email address that you listed on the FAFSA. The 2025-2026 FAFSA application (for attendance between Summer 2025 and June 2026) is now open. The 2025-2026 WASFA is now open. As of July 1, 2025 we are continuing to determine eligibility for students who have submitted all required 2025-2026 documents and are enrolled in Summer quarter classes. We have begun processing for the 2025-2026 aid year, and are accepting documents. Students enrolled in Summer quarter will be prioritized. Students are prioritized by date of quarterly enrollment and FAFSA/WASFA application competition date. Students who submitted FAFSA/WASFA after the priority deadline may need to secure alternate methods of payment for tuition to ensure they are not dropped for non-payment. If students are determined to be eligible, they will receive eligible aid retroactively. Check your FAFSA status at studentaid.gov Delays in processing from Department of Education may affect our review of your eligibility. It is important to file your FAFSA, check back regularly on its status, and make any required corrections. Check your FAFSA Submission Summary to see if there are any messages and respond accordingly. Ensure your FAFSA is signed by all contributors and that you have a Student Aid Index (SAI) noted on your FAFSA Submission Summary. To receive most types of financial aid, you will need to complete the following steps. You are encouraged to begin these steps approximately two months before you plan on attending. Complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) IF ONE of the following applies to you (the student): Complete a Washington Application for State Financial Aid (WASFA) if the following apply to you (the student): Be aware that there may be two FAFSA/WASFA applications open at the same time. The following shows which application to complete based on the quarter you will attend. If you plan to attend Summer 2024 through Spring 2025, complete the 2024-2025 FAFSA or WASFA, available now. If you plan to attend Summer 2025 through Spring 2026, complete the 2025-2026 FAFSA or WASFA, anticipated available December 1, 2024. About one week after submitting your financial aid application, log into ctclink to view your financial aid status and to review documents that are required. You will also receive an email to notify you when documents are required. Items listed under \"Information We Need From You\" must be submitted before your financial aid will be determined. Use the link in the portal to access required forms. Financial aid awarded to you will be listed under \"My Awards\". BTC delivers your refund with BankMobile Disbursements, a technology solution, powered by BMTX, Inc. To receive a refund in a timely manner, you must select your refund preference using the information mailed to you. Your refund can be used for educational expenses such as books, supplies, housing, food and transportation. Contact the Student Financial Resources office if you did not receive refund information by mail. Financial aid is generally awarded based on full-time enrollment level (12+ credits). If you plan to enroll for fewer than 12 credits, notify our office by submitting an email to finaid@btc.edu. Adjustments are made through the 10th day of each quarter. Your academic progress is monitored quarterly. To remain eligible for financial aid, you must meet the requirements outlined in the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress policy. If you decide to withdraw from one or more credits, you may owe a repayment of some or all of the financial aid you received. Need help understanding FAFSA and WASFA? See videos, FAQs, helpful links and more at BTC's FAFSA/WASFA Resources page. Students who meet the general dates below and are enrolled will receive priority consideration for financial aid. Some types of funding are limited and are only awarded to students who apply early. Students who meet these dates will also be notified of their eligibility before the start of the quarter. Please see BTC's Calendar for quarterly specific dates and information. After receiving your application for financial aid, we determine the types of funding and amounts for which you qualify. We use the Student Aid Index (SAI), income, assets and family size to determine eligibility. Need-based financial aid, such as grants, is provided to students from low- to middle-income households. Some types of grants are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Non-need-based financial aid, such as certain types of loans and scholarships, may be available to students who apply. Your Student Aid Index (SAI) is an index number used to determine your eligibility for federal student financial aid. This number results from the financial information you provide in your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or Washington Application for State Financial Aid (WASFA). Your SAI is calculated according to a formula established by law and considers your family\u2019s federal tax information (FTI) that is retrieved directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Your SAI is used to determine the types and amount of financial aid you qualify for. The Cost of Attendance (COA) is an estimate of the amount of money you may need to attend BTC for a period of time. The COA includes direct school expenses as well as an allowance for basic living expenses. The COA can vary depending on your program and other factors. You are encouraged to review your own expenses to determine if there are ways you reduce expenses or if there are expenses not included. Students may contact the Student Financial Resources office if they would like to discuss their need for adjustments to their COA. 2025-2026 Cost of Attendance Example for a WA Resident attending full-time (15+ credits) for three quarters. Direct expenses | Tuition & Fees | $6,000 | | Books & supplies | $528 | | TOTAL: | $6528 | Indirect expenses | Living expenses (food & housing) | $17,702 | | Transportation | $2,790 | | Miscellaneous/Personal | $1,908 | | TOTAL: | $28,928 | Most BTC students utilize a combination of financial aid and other sources of income to cover their expenses. This is a valuable strategy to limit the amount of debt from borrowing loans.

    "description": "Amazon Awarded Bitcoin-Related Cloud Computing Patent The patent envisions bitcoin's potential use in cloud computing services on Amazon Web Services. E-commerce giant Amazon has been awarded a bitcoin-related cloud computing patent that envisions the use of digital currencies as payment for cloud computing services on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon\u2019s cloud is by far the biggest remote computing service on the market. Market research firm Gartner estimates AWS annual revenue at upwards of $3bn, and it believes Amazon\u2019s cloud has five times the capacity of its next 14 rivals. The news follow's Amazon's public statements that suggest is not presently interested in accepting digital currencies, despite such suggestions from rivals like eBay. Earlier this April, Amazon\u2019s payments head Tom Taylor revealed that the company has no immediate plans to \"engage bitcoin\". USPTO Patent 8,719,131 The Amazon patent was granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as Patent 8,719,131. It was filed on 29th March 2012, but has recently surfaced online. The patent involves allocating financial risk and reward in a multi-tenant environment. The abstract reads: \"Multi-tenant resources can be funded using payment submitted with requests for those resources, such that the resources do not need to be associated with a specific user account. A resource can be allocated and available as long as payment has been provided. If a user wants the resource to be available for additional processing, for example, the user can submit another request with additional funding.\" The patent goes on to specify how funding would work in more detail, stating: \"The funding can come in the form of donations from any user, or in the form of investments where the investor expects some return on the investment in the form of revenue, visibility, or other such compensation. One or more management components can track funding for various resources, can accept and select bids for period of sponsorship, and can manage various donation models.\u201d Bitcoin funding The system requires a source of funding, such as a digital cash payment upon request. Bitcoin is just one form of payment described in the patent description. The patent reads: \"Various types of digital cash, electronic money or crypto-currency can be used, such as bitcoins provided by the Bitcoin P2P Currency System.\" Speed is essential, for example, as a user might request access to a server for just two hours and pay for it digitally. The patent could be described as enabling an '\u00e0 la carte' approach to cloud computing \u2013 take what you need for as long as you need it, with no subscription or long-term obligation, no need to plan ahead. Everything as a Service Cloud computing revolves around several basic models, such as Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Software as a service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), and there are a number of variations and hybrid business models. Cloud offers a lot of flexibility in terms of hardware, but flexibility in terms of paying for cloud services is another thing. Amazon\u2019s patent, with or without bitcoin in the mix, aims to deliver pay-per-use resource allocation, maximising efficiency and reducing costs for the end user. While this does not make much of a difference for businesses, it could have implications for consumer-oriented cloud services.

    "description": "Businesses in the blockchain and cryptoasset space are increasingly looking to utilise digital currency and other cryptoassets as an alternative to or alongside other, more traditional employee incentive arrangements, such as share and option plans. Cryptoassets have the potential to deliver significant value to employees in a form that is customisable to commercial objectives by creating an opportunity to coordinate value alignment between their employees and a decentralized network. But this form of incentivisation also raises complex questions about the legal, regulatory, and tax consequences of employees holding cryptoassets. These questions become only more acute when the company\u2019s workforce is expanding globally. Many jurisdictions are still getting to grips with the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets, and the approach and level of certainty differs from country to country. The tax implications of crypto-based incentives in different jurisdictions should therefore be carefully considered before adopting a plan and granting awards. The UK accounts for about 8% of the global crypto workforce and a third of the workforce in Europe.1 HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) published guidance in 2021 setting out its view on the taxation treatment of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets, although significant gaps and uncertainties remain. The UK has not introduced a specific regime for taxing cryptoassets, instead choosing to apply existing tax rules to this new asset class. This means that the tax treatment can differ depending on the type of cryptoasset and the particular circumstances in which the cryptoasset is acquired, held, and ultimately disposed of. Grant of Crypto-based Incentive Awards HMRC guidance confirms that cryptoassets received as part of a UK employee\u2019s income \u2014 including as part of an incentive award \u2014 fall within the definition of \u201cmoney\u2019s worth\u201d for UK tax purposes; therefore, the value of the cryptoasset on receipt (net of any value paid by the employee) will be subject to income tax as earnings. Under the UK\u2019s current regulatory regime cryptoassets are divided into three main types and this categorisation has also been adopted by HMRC. Valuing the cryptoasset at the time of grant may be challenging depending on the type of asset being granted. \u2018Exchange tokens\u2019 such as Bitcoin, which have an indexed value, should be straightforward to value at the point of grant, but if the incentive award consists of \u2018utility tokens\u2019 (allowing access to goods or services on a blockchain platform) or \u2018security tokens\u2019 (providing rights or obligations similar to a share or debt instrument), these can be much harder to value at the point of grant and would likely require a specialist valuation. Any tax liabilities arising at grant could create a dry tax cost for the employee. This may make a cryptoasset award less attractive, particularly given the pricing volatility of many cryptoassets. In a worst-case scenario, this could lead to a large up-front taxable value without any guarantee of future appreciation. Care therefore needs to be taken to consider the timing of any cryptoasset award in the context of its market value to ensure it is an effective incentivisation tool for the company. Readily Convertible Assets Like any money\u2019s worth receipt, getting the correct valuation to determine and account for the right amount of income tax is important from the employee\u2019s perspective. It will also be a key issue for the employer company to the extent that the relevant cryptoassets are treated as \u201creadily convertible assets\u201d (RCAs) for UK tax purposes. When assets that are given to employees under an incentive scheme are not RCAs, any income tax liability arising in respect of the receipt of that asset will be accounted for by the employee via their self-assessment tax returns. However, if the asset falls within the RCA definition, the tax liability will instead need to be accounted for by their employer through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) payroll system, and, in addition, there will be an obligation to account for employer and employee National Insurance contributions (NICs). The employer will then need to recover the amount paid on the employee\u2019s behalf via deductions from other cash compensation payments. The RCA definition is wide-ranging and depends on the facts and circumstances of the asset at the time of receipt. However, where the asset is tradable on certain exchanges or where there are, or are likely to be, trading arrangements in respect of the asset, it will fall within the RCA definition. This means that exchange tokens such as Bitcoin and other trading cryptocurrencies are likely to be RCAs, as will any other tokens in cases where trading arrangements exist at the time they are received by the employee. Whether or not an incentive cryptoasset should be treated as an RCA will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis to ensure that any taxes arising at the time of grant are accounted for correctly and by the right person. Currencies and Future Sale UK employees who are granted cryptoassets as part of an incentive scheme will need to consider the UK tax implications of any foreign currency exchange fluctuations during the employees\u2019 period of ownership. This can be a more complex exercise with certain cryptoassets such as NFTs, where the cryptoassets\u2019 value may be denominated in another digital currency such as Ethereum, potentially making a double conversion necessary to determine their sterling value. HMRC guidance makes it clear that a cryptoasset is a chargeable asset for UK capital gains tax purposes, meaning that gains on the sale of cryptoassets are taxable. Therefore, on ultimate disposal, a UK employee may be subject to capital gains tax on any value appreciation above the initial value of the cryptoasset at grant. Phantom Token Awards Given the complexity around cross-border grant of cryptoassets to employees, an alternative route may be to grant phantom crypto incentive awards to UK employees. Similar to a phantom share or share option award, a phantom cryptoasset award would provide the UK employee with incentivisation based on the future value of an identified cryptoasset but without physical grant of that asset. The grant of a phantom cryptoasset award would not result in the day-one valuation or dry tax concerns that are outlined above. However, any future returns on crystallisation of the phantom award would be taxed as employment income and would attract employer and employee NICs liabilities. Companies therefore need to balance the potential up-front tax costs and complexities of granting cryptoassets against the additional tax costs of flipping to a phantom cryptoasset plan. Beyond the UK This summary considers only the potential tax considerations on grant of crypto asset awards to employees in the UK. Where groups are expanding into other countries in Europe and considering granting crypto asset incentives to local employees, the rules will need to be reviewed in each relevant jurisdiction because valuation metrics, taxing points, and applicable rates will differ from country to country.

    "description": "Alfredo B. D. Silva is a partner, Ali U. Nardali is Of Counsel, and Aria Kashefi is an associate at Morrison & Foerster LLP. This post is based on a Morrison & Foerster publication by Mr. Silva, Mr. Nardali, and Mr. Kashefi, which originally appeared in Bloomberg Law. In the past year, blockchain tokens (more commonly referred to as \u201cvirtual tokens\u201d or just \u201ctokens\u201d) have nudged their way into mainstream consciousness with the proliferation of \u201cinitial coin offerings,\u201d or \u201cICOs,\u201d and the blockbuster rises\u2014and drops\u2014in the prices of cryptocurrencies. An emerging trend sees companies and virtual organizations leveraging the value of these tokens, not only for non-dilutive capital raising purposes, but also to compensate and incentivize founders, directors, employees, consultants and other service providers. Just as with issuances of founder\u2019s stock, stock options and other traditional equity-based compensation, token-based compensation requires significant consideration from both a securities law and a tax law perspective. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) initially provided guidance in July 2017 directing practitioners to apply the test articulated in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. when determining whether an issuer\u2019s tokens would be considered securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the cornerstone of U.S. regulatory regime with respect to securities. Recent actions brought by the SEC, as well as speeches by its chairman and members of the recently formed cyber unit of its enforcement division, however, have suggested that from the SEC\u2019s perspective, all ICOs conducted to date, even offerings of so-called \u201cutility tokens,\u201d have borne significant hallmarks of securities offerings. While on a case-by-case basis issuers and practitioners nevertheless may wish to evaluate a given token and token offering using the Howey test, for the purposes of this article we assume that tokens being used as the basis for service provider compensation would be viewed as securities by the SEC and so should be issued in accordance with the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) has also issued guidance regarding taxation of \u201cconvertible virtual currencies\u201d that we believe is also likely to apply to token-based compensation to service providers. Based on this guidance, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), tokens issued to individuals in exchange for services would generally be treated as compensation and, as with most compensation, the issuance would generally be subject to income and payroll taxes. As the cryptocurrency market increasingly demands rationalized founder and developer token ownership structures, including appropriate vesting and lock-ups, and as ICOs and other token generation events (collectively referred to as \u201cTGEs\u201d) are increasingly being deferred until after production of a minimum viable product, more sophisticated token-based award structures have been developed. By and large, these token-based awards emulate traditional equity-based awards, including restricted tokens, token options and restricted token units. This is not a coincidence: compensatory award structures are largely tax driven, and the Code provisions applicable to token-based awards are the same as those applicable to traditional equity-based awards. Interestingly, we believe that whereas (i) restricted stock awards have predominantly been awarded at companies\u2019 early stages, (ii) restricted stock units have been more widely used by companies whose stock is publicly traded and more mature private companies and (iii) stock options are heavily used by companies at all stages, in each case, the opposite should be true with the analogous token-based awards. Choosing a Token-Based Award Tokens and Restricted Tokens A token award would allow the recipient to acquire tokens immediately. With a token award, either the recipient pays for newly issued, outstanding tokens, or the recipient is awarded the tokens as compensation for past or future services, without the recipient paying any cash purchase price. If the tokens are restricted tokens, they would also be subject to vesting based on continued service or achievement of performance targets and can be subject to accelerated vesting upon pre-determined triggers, such as the occurrence of a change of control transaction, the termination of an employee without cause, or achievement of technical milestones for the token platform. If the recipient ceases to provide services to the issuer (e.g., if the recipient is an employee and quits), the issuer would have the right, but not the obligation, to repurchase any remaining restricted tokens that have not yet vested, typically at the original purchase paid by the recipient (if any). Similar to stock awards, token awards will likely be treated by the IRS as property received in connection with the performance of services. With respect to token awards issued without vesting restrictions, the recipient will be taxed in the year the award is made if and to the extent the fair market value of the tokens at the time of the award exceeds the amount paid by the recipient for the tokens (this difference being deemed ordinary income to the recipient that is also subject to payroll taxes). If the tokens are restricted tokens, however, the recipient will be taxed on the difference between the fair market value of the tokens at the time of vesting and the amount paid by the recipient for the tokens (i.e., the \u201cspread\u201d), unless the recipient files an election with the IRS under Section 83(b) of the Code (commonly referred to as an \u201c83(b) Election\u201d) within 30 days of receiving the restricted tokens. So, for example, if a portion of the restricted tokens vests each month, and the recipient does not timely file the 83(b) Election, then the tax obligation will be incurred each month in respect of the tranche that vested (and the recipient would likely want to sell all or a portion of her vested tokens on the secondary market to receive the cash needed to pay the tax on this spread). It is important that a recipient of restricted tokens carefully considers whether filing an 83(b) Election makes sense in consideration of applicable circumstances. If a recipient makes a timely 83(b) Election, in the year of grant, the recipient will be taxed on any difference between the fair market value of the award on the date of grant and the amount actually paid for the restricted tokens, if any, but will defer taxation on all gains in value post-grant until the tokens are actually sold to a third party or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction, and will convert all such post-grant appreciation to capital gains. The risk, however, in making an 83(b) Election is that the recipient must pay tax based on the \u201cspread\u201d of all awarded tokens at the time of grant, but if the tokens ultimately decrease in value as they vest compared to their value on the date of grant, or if all or a portion of the tokens are forfeited back to the issuer because the recipient\u2019s service terminates prior to full vesting, the pre-paid tax on value in excess of actual economic gain from the tokens will not be recoverable. Each recipient of a restricted token award will therefore need to weigh the potential advantages of starting the clock for capital gains treatment on post-grant gains against the risks that the tokens may lose value or be forfeited. Indeed, while the principles of the 83(b) Election are the same as between restricted tokens and restricted stock, the difference in fact patterns around their issuance complicates that decision calculus. The \u201cfounder\u2019s stock\u201d issued to start-up service providers at the formation of the corporation typically has de minimis value, such that receipt of restricted stock (whether in exchange for a purchase price or as a restricted stock bonus), followed by an immediate 83(b) Election, results in minimal or no tax on the award in the year of grant. Plus, making an 83(b) Election provides protection against incurrence of tax liabilities as stock vests during periods while a start-up is privately held and lacks a secondary market to provide service providers with liquidity alternatives to help pay the tax. In contrast, the value of token awards will be tied to the TGE price (if issued in a TGE) or trading values on the secondary market thereafter, such that a recipient of a restricted token award may have to pay tax on a significant amount of \u201cspread\u201d in the year of grant if she wishes to make an 83(b) Election to start her capital gains treatment, and she may have less concern about inability to sell tokens as they vest if a robust trading market exists following the TGE. Token Options Similar to a traditional stock option, a token option would provide the recipient the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a pre-determined number of tokens at a pre-set price. The exercisability of the option can be subject to vesting, just as with restricted tokens, and the option would expire some short period of time after the recipient ceases to provide services to the issuer. Token options are likely to be subject to the same tax treatment as nonqualified stock options\u2014no taxation upon grant, but upon exercise, the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the exercised tokens over the aggregate exercise price of the exercised tokens (i.e., the \u201cspread\u201d) would be compensation income subject to ordinary income and payroll taxes. It is unclear whether token options will be exempt or subject to the rules under Section 409A of the Code. Options are generally exempt from Section 409A if they are granted \u201cat the money\u201d and cover \u201cservice recipient stock,\u201d but there is no definitive guidance to suggest that the IRS would consider tokens awarded to service providers as \u201cservice recipient stock.\u201d Consequently, issuers should generally assume that token options are subject to Section 409A of the Code and take great care to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. For example, a token option that mimics a plain vanilla stock option whereby the optionee has discretion to exercise vested options over multiple years would not comply with Section 409A and would subject the optionee to significant penalties. Instead, a Section 409A-compliant token option would be exercisable only on certain specified events, such as a specific year or upon an earlier separation from service or change in control. These limitations may make token options less attractive to issuers, relative to traditional stock options. Although a token option grant does not result in the issuance of a token until exercise, granting the option before the underlying tokens are generated and reserved may be complicated by a number of factors. For example, issuers would need to determine the per token option strike price and fair market value on the grant date, both as a business matter as well as for purposes of exemption from Section 409A of the Code and thresholds for compliance with Rule 701 of the Securities Act, discussed below. Accordingly, token issuers should consider an alternative token compensation structure pre-TGE. Restricted Token Units Much like a restricted stock unit (or RSU), a restricted token unit (or RTU) is a promise to pay property to the recipient in the future, usually after time or performance-based vesting conditions are met. For example, a grant of one RTU would entitle the service provider to payment of one token following vesting. Often, tokens are paid shortly after vesting. However, it is possible to pay the tokens a period of months or years after vesting. Infrequently, vested RTUs are paid in cash (equal to the fair market value of the tokens at the time they would otherwise be paid to the service provider), rather than actual tokens. Payment of a vested RTU, whether in cash or in stock, is often referred to as \u201csettlement\u201d of the vested RTU. The vesting feature of RTUs would work similar to that of a restricted token or a token option. While RTUs may be issued prior to the TGE, settlement of vested RTUs into tokens would need to be delayed at least until the issuer\u2019s TGE (which could result in \u201cdeferred RTU\u201d treatment under Section 409A of the Code). Upon termination of continuous service, unvested RTUs would automatically be cancelled. There is typically no tax impact at the time of grant of an RTU. When the underlying units are paid in tokens, the fair market value of the tokens will be treated as income received by the service provider, subject to ordinary income and payroll taxes. Given the various mechanical and tax issues involved, we expect to see the market for token compensation moving toward restricted token units, particularly for early stage companies. Issuers can make RTU awards pre-TGE, but defer settlement of RTUs until after the TGE. This may permit recipients to delay taxation on the token until there is liquidity, since income from RTUs would be taxed not at grant or vesting, but when tokens are ultimately paid to the service provider. For issuers who do not delay settlement until the TGE, we expect to see hybrid settlement terms, where the RTU settles in tokens if the settlement date is at or after the TGE or settles in cash if the recipient\u2019s service with the issuer terminates prior to the TGE. As noted above, if the RTUs are settled in tokens, the recipient will be taxed based on the fair market value of the tokens at the time of settlement, which could be determinable based on the prevailing trading prices for the tokens on prominent exchanges. If cash is received as settlement of RTUs instead of tokens, then the amount of the income recognized will simply be the amount of cash received. RTUs have other advantages over token options as well, including that fewer RTUs would be needed to have the same compensatory impact to the recipient as a token option, leaving more tokens available for issuance to other service providers. A token option ceases to have value once the fair market value of the underlying token becomes less than the corresponding exercise price. For example, a token option covering one token with an exercise price of $10 loses its value once the secondary market for the underlying tokens falls below $10. However, an RTU will have some value as long the issuer\u2019s tokens are worth anything. Even an \u201cin the money\u201d token option is worth less than an equivalent RTU: if a single token option has an exercise price of $10, and the issuer\u2019s tokens are trading at $12 per share, the token option is effectively only worth $2, whereas a single RTU would be worth the full $12. Because RTUs deliver this \u201cfull value,\u201d service providers should be satisfied with fewer RTUs. Note that an RSU with one underlying share is typically perceived as tantamount to an option to buy three to five shares of stock; it remains to be seen whether the market will ascribe the same ratio to analogous token-based awards. Regardless of what form of token-based award issuers choose to use, they should be mindful that token-based awards to employees will be subject to federal and state income tax withholding (at supplemental withholding rates) and payroll taxes. Employers that fail to withhold such taxes are secondarily liable to the tax regulators for such taxes, and under certain circumstances could face an additional penalty equal to 100% of the taxes that were not withheld. Limitations on Issuances of Token-Based Awards The factors that impact the form of token-based award an issuer chooses to use are largely tax driven (to convert appreciation to capital gains and to defer taxation until a liquidity event) and apply regardless of whether or not the issuer\u2019s token is deemed to be a \u201csecurity\u201d under the Securities Act. While we assume for the purposes of this article that the SEC would consider any token issued as compensation to be a security, even if a utility token were not a security, many practitioners believe that an agreement to acquire a utility token in the future itself constitutes an investment contract under Howey and so is a security. Thus, like a SAFT, or Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, a token-based award in any event may be deemed a security, and its issuance should be compliant with the Securities Act, regardless of whether the issuer believes tokens underlying the awards are or will be \u201cutility tokens.\u201d The provisions of the Securities Act are drafted very broadly. As a result, they will apply to any type of issuer, including a decentralized virtual organization. The Securities Act requires that no securities be offered or sold for value unless the issuance has been registered or is exempt from registration requirements. Registration is an arduous, drawn out and expensive process, and in any event it is not a practical alternative solely to permit issuance of securities for compensation of service providers. Instead, the common federal exemption traditionally used by start-ups and other companies to issue traditional equity-based compensatory awards (such as restricted stock, stock options and RSUs), and now used by companies and virtual organizations to issue token based compensatory awards, is Rule 701. Covered Service Providers Rule 701 imposes various limitations on, and conditions for, the issuance of securities without registration. First, token-based awards granted under Rule 701 may only be made to the employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of the issuer (or certain of the issuer\u2019s affiliates). At first glance, this would seem to mean almost any service provider could qualify to receive token-based awards under Rule 701 by serving as a consultant or advisor to the issuer on a project, including, for example, service as a third-party developer, TGE bookrunner, public relations provider, etc. However, there are special requirements as to the availability of Rule 701 for awards to consultants and advisors. First, only natural persons are eligible for the exemption, though a consultant operating through a wholly owned LLC, personal corporation or other corporate entity may in some cases be granted token-based awards in reliance on Rule 701. Second, the consultant or advisor must be providing bona fide services to the issuer or its affiliates. Third, the services rendered cannot be in connection with a capital raising transaction, such as an ICO or SAFT sale. This last condition means that token-based awards cannot be issued in reliance on Rule 701 to a consultant or advisor in exchange for finding investors for the issuer or advertising, promoting or facilitating the sale of its tokens in any way. While Rule 701 may not be available for issuing token-based awards to some consultants or advisors, other exemptions from registration under the Securities Act may be available, including, for example, Regulation D, if the consultant or advisor is an \u201caccredited investor,\u201d or Regulation S, if the consultant or advisor is not a U.S. person, and the transaction meets the other requirements of the applicable exemption. Note, however, that there are a host of securities law restrictions that make compensatory arrangements in connection with fundraising efforts dangerous for issuers, especially where success fees are involved. Written Plan or Agreement Issuers may rely on Rule 701 to issue token-based awards only where the awards are granted under a written plan or agreement. Depending on the jurisdictions of the issuer and the award recipient, and how those jurisdictions interpret electronic contracts, a \u201csmart contract\u201d governing the terms of an award of security tokens may not satisfy the requirement for a written plan or agreement, even if its source code is publicly available to the award recipient. Until smart contracts are more widely recognized by regulators and courts as legally binding obligations, we recommend that issuers adopt a written token incentive plan with the same specificity as traditional equity incentive plans. Companies issuing token-based awards should also document each award using individual award agreements with each recipient and must provide to the award recipient a copy both of the written plan and the individual award agreement. While issuers may be tempted to draft token incentive plans by simply replacing \u201cstock\u201d with \u201ctoken\u201d in precedential equity incentive plans, care should be taken in drafting a token incentive plan\u2014for example, provisions related to lock-ups, changes in control, recapitalizations and post-settlement transfer restrictions either do not apply or have to be significantly altered for application in the context of tokens. Volume Limitations Rule 701 imposes limitations on the maximum number of token-based awards that can be granted in reliance on its exemptions. This maximum is determined using a technical and complex formula. To summarize, the aggregate sales price or fair value of the token-based awards made in reliance on Rule 701 during any consecutive 12-month period generally cannot exceed the greater of $1,000,000 or 15% of the issuer\u2019s assets as of its most recent balance sheet date. However, if that token-based award value-based threshold has been met, an issuer may still issue token-based awards during the applicable consecutive 12-month period until the total number of tokens underlying token-based awards made in such period reaches 15% of the total number of tokens outstanding as of the issuer\u2019s most recent balance sheet date. Since many issuers are making token-based awards prior to the TGE, such that zero tokens will have been outstanding as of the last balance sheet date, the determination as to the maximum tokens they may issue under Rule 701 will largely depend on the dollar value of their token-based awards. The question then becomes how to determine that value. To analogize to traditional equity-based awards, if the awardee has to pay a certain amount of money, Ether or other currency (whether virtual or fiat) to obtain the token (whether upon \u201cexercise\u201d or at the time the award is granted), the amount so paid or payable will likely be the deemed sale price of that award for purposes of Rule 701. Ironically, this means the Rule 701 value will be easier to determine for restricted tokens and token options, where, for the reasons discussed above, a trading market for the underlying tokens should already exist that supports calculation of the value, as compared to RTUs, where the issuer will need to estimate the fair value at the time of grant. Note that if the amount to be paid by the recipient is denominated in Ether, Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency, a further complication arises in converting that amount into dollars for purposes of testing the relevant Rule 701 thresholds. (Recipients should also note that current IRS guidance indicates that using cryptocurrencies to pay for an award will also cause that cryptocurrency to be taxed.) Regardless of the method used to achieve the conversion, that method should be applied consistently to all awards over time. Given these volume limitations, to preserve the ability to use Rule 701 for future awards, issuers should consider making awards to certain service providers in reliance on such other exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act where possible, including, for example, Regulation D, which also covers issuances to directors and executive officers. Disclosure Requirements If a company grants token-based awards with aggregate purchase price or fair value (determined as discussed above) exceeding $5,000,000 in any 12-month period, additional disclosure must be provided to the person to whom the award is issued. This additional disclosure would include a discussion of the risk factors associated with an investment in the issuer\u2019s securities as well as financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP that may be no older than 180 days. For token options, this disclosure, if required, must be provided a reasonable time before the option is exercised. In the case of restricted tokens, RTUs and other token-based awards, however, the disclosure would need to be made prior to the token based award being granted. Token issuers that would find it impracticable or otherwise problematic to prepare and provide this level of disclosure should take care to monitor their token-based award programs to ensure that neither the original issuance of their token-based awards nor the issuance of tokens upon exercise or settlement of token options, RTUs or other derivative token-based awards would cause the $5 million threshold to be exceeded. State Law Requirements The offering and sale of token-based awards must also comply with the state securities laws (commonly referred to as \u201cblue sky\u201d laws) of the jurisdiction of the issuer and its award recipients. Luckily, a number of states include an exemption for securities issuances based on compliance with Rule 701, though some, such as California, may impose additional requirements for exemption of the applicable awards from registration or qualification. As such, it is even more important for issuers to be mindful of the terms and conditions of Rule 701 when granting token-based awards and to conduct a full \u201cblue sky\u201d analysis based on the residence of token recipients. Are Tokens the New Equity? Ultimately, the same securities, tax and other rules that apply to compensatory equity awards tend to apply to compensatory tokens as well. Whereas the market for compensatory equity is well understood, compensatory token-based awards raise new questions for issuers to answer: Should the issuer offer both equity and token incentive awards? What percentage of tokens to be generated should be reserved for awards to service providers? Should token-based awards be allocated among service providers in the same proportions as traditional equity-based awards? In any event, we do know that tokens may present solutions to some problems with traditional equity-based awards. For example, token-based awards can be automated using smart contracts, which could decrease administrative costs and errors that are sometimes incidental to equity-based awards. In addition, they more directly incentivize employees to develop the company\u2019s product portfolio so as to expand the application and value of the awarded tokens. And of course, token-based awards can be a non dilutive form of executive compensation.",

    "description": "Top 15 Blockchain Grants to Fund Your Web 3.0 Product in 2024 Table of content Blockchain has changed the digital space once and for all. Thus, it\u2019s unsurprising that the blockchain development sector is booming today, with a CAGR of 56%+ and an expected market size of $163+ billion by 2029. Hundreds of blockchain-based projects pop up daily, and every ecosystem and protocol works hard to preserve their value and significance. Community-based development initiatives are one of the aspects blockchain companies use to move forward and respond to user needs. Thus, many blockchain projects have launched grant programs to incentivize contributors and hand-pick the most promising use cases and proposals in line with their mission, vision, and values. If you\u2019re a small startup or an individual coder passionate about Web3, look through the list of currently ongoing grant programs to find a source of funding for your business ideas. It\u2019s pretty easy to start out in the Web3 world supporting enthusiasts like you! How to Get Funding for Your Blockchain Project? Most developers or startups face a major challenge: getting enough money to proceed. Vital steps to secure sufficient funding are: - Determine a clear business case for your app or development project; identify what pain points it may resolve for the business or users. - Choose a specific blockchain to base your development on. This way, you will narrow your focus and deliver a suitable solution for a specific company. - For projects with an end-user in mind, you may opt for crowdfunding. Place a project\u2019s description on a crowdfunding platform and collect funds from interested users, sharing your profits with them upon a successful launch. - Look out for angel investors; scan the market to see what products and technologies such venture capitalists are interested in now and apply with a well-formulated business proposal. One important point to remember is that investors are generally attracted only to top-quality projects with no security loopholes and a clear, consistent whitepaper and logic. Thus, it\u2019s necessary to hire qualified developers to build your project, ensuring that you end up with a product interesting for all stakeholders.

    "description": "Arthur Hayes\u2019 Maelstrom fund has announced a new Bitcoin grant program to advance the technical development of the world\u2019s first blockchain network. Maelstrom\u2019s new Bitcoin (BTC) grant program will be offering developers grants between $50,000 to $150,000 on a 12-month basis, with grant stacking of up to $250,000 per individual developer. The program aims to give back to Bitcoin open-source developers and further promote the development of the network. According to the announcement: \u201cThe objective of the program is to help with the technical development of Bitcoin and enhance its resilience, scalability, censorship resistance, and privacy characteristics. We have the capacity to support Bitcoin developers and are committed to an open and transparent grant process.\u201d Maelstrom is a family office fund investing in decentralized technologies. It is led by CIO Arthur Hayes, a popular crypto entrepreneur and the former CEO of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange. Related: Mt. Gox repayments will only cause Bitcoin sell pressure among \u2018paper hands\u2019 \u2014 Analyst Bitcoin grants could be awarded as soon as Q3 A potential grantee will be expected to contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s technical development, including pull requests or review work for the Bitcoin Core software project. Grants will be issued for 12 months in Bitcoin, Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC), and Tether USD (USDT), according to the announcement. Grants are expected to be awarded to developers during the third or fourth quarter of 2024. Developers can submit their grant applications with Maelstrom until August 25. Interest in Bitcoin development was reignited this year, first because of the newfound interest brought by the United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the 2024 Bitcoin halving that occurred in April. Related: Bitcoin bears trapped, but can BTC price surpass $70K by August? More innovation for Bitcoin-native DeFi? Maelstrom\u2019s grants program could potentially lead to more innovation in Bitcoin-native decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as Bitcoin DeFi or BTCFi. Bitcoin DeFi is a wider developer movement that aims to add more utility to the Bitcoin network. Interest in Bitcoin DeFi rose with the debut of Runes, a new protocol for issuing fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network that launched on April 20, the day of the halving. The emergence of Runes and Bitcoin DeFi came from a desire to add more utility to the world\u2019s safest blockchain network, according to Rich Rines, a Core DAO contributor building Bitcoin DeFi solutions. Rines told Cointelegraph: \u201c[Bitcoin] started as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system then morphed more into a store value and now protects $1.5 trillion of wealth. We\u2019ve seen over the last one and a half years this desire to add more utility to the underlying Bitcoin through the rise of Ordinals, token protocols like BRC 20s and now Runes.\u201d However, Runes may only be a stepping stone for Bitcoin DeFi, as we see more innovative token standards developed on the Bitcoin network.

The grant was given to Jon Atack, a senior developer at Bitcoin Core who started contributing in 2019. In a press release sent to Cointelegraph, Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes said that the financial support allows Atack to focus on his work on Bitcoin. Hayes said that one of the fund\u2019s goals is to support seasoned Bitcoin Core developers. The executive said: \u201cJon has complete freedom to work on whichever part of the Bitcoin codebase he likes from any location around the globe. As a senior developer on Bitcoin Core, Jon represents an early adopter and key member of the community.\u201d Hayes hopes to identify more grant candidates to help educate the next generation of developers within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin needs continued vigilance, review and updates In the announcement, Atack said that open-source software and Bitcoin play a role in striving for causes like human freedom, decentralization of power, individual privacy and self-sovereignty. However, maintaining the network requires continued work. Atack explained: \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t perfect. Among other things, it needs further decentralization, continued vigilance, review, bug-fixing, updates, maintenance, and improved robustness, performance, privacy, scaling, documentation and user experience.\u201d Because of this, the developer pledged to help and service the network and said that he would continue to work on the decentralization and robustness of Bitcoin. \u201cMy time will be primarily invested in reviewing and context-packing proposals for these projects to help move them forward and potentially catch breaking changes and be able to help maintain them,\u201d Atack added. Maelstrom told Cointelegraph that Atack received a $100,000 grant. The developer is also receiving another grant from the Bitcoin initiative OpenSats. Related: Bitcoin core dev to \u2018unite\u2019 Bitcoin and Ethereum with cross-chain tunnels Maelstrom Bitcoin grant program Maelstrom announced the grant program on July 17 to advance Bitcoin\u2019s development. The grant program offers funding ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 on a 12-month basis, which can stack up to $250,000 per individual developer. In a previous Cointelegraph interview, Hayes emphasized the importance of supporting developers in maintaining the network. The executive said that the ecosystem could be vulnerable to threats without funding. Magazine: 68% of Runes are in the red \u2014 Are they really an upgrade for Bitcoin?",

Despite the critical nature of their work\u2014the Bitcoin network would not survive without them\u2014funding for Bitcoin\u2019s open-source developers remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we\u2019d like to share with readers the dynamics of Bitcoin\u2019s developer network, focusing on the challenges and opportunities associated with funding its ongoing development. To read case studies that showcase the important work undertaken by the open-source Bitcoin developer network, please scroll to the end of this blog post. Bitcoin\u2019s Open-Source Software Open-source software (OSS) is Bitcoin\u2019s heartbeat. From its inception, anyone has been able to contribute, view, and modify Bitcoin\u2019s source code. Open source has been fundamental to Bitcoin\u2019s growth, enabling a global community of developers to collaborate on improving the software and seeking to ensure its security and stability. Thanks to its open-source nature, Bitcoin incorporates a unique system of checks and balances that encourages the innovation and maintenance of its protocol while ensuring that changes are in the interest of all stakeholders. Core developers who architect and maintain the Bitcoin protocol are key to the system of checks and balances, as shown below. Their primary responsibility is to write and update the foundational software upon which the entire Bitcoin ecosystem operates: they define the rules for transactions, block creation, and consensus among nodes. That said, their power is not absolute. The beauty of this ecosystem is that modifications proposed by any developer must be adopted by the broader network. Bitcoin's Governance Model Importantly, the system of checks and balances is not political, but it is central to Bitcoin's resilience in the face of attacks and vulnerabilities. Why? The answer lies in Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized and open development process. Because its code is accessible publicly, developers can inspect it for potential flaws and patch it rapidly. A collaborative ecosystem fosters a culture of continuous improvement, with new features and updates proposed and discussed openly within the community. Bitcoin and The Public Goods Dilemma The features that make open-source software a powerful tool for innovation also can create challenges for sustaining Bitcoin\u2019s development over time. Understanding open-source software as a public good is essential to grasp the broader dilemma facing Bitcoin. Open-source software (OSS) like the Bitcoin protocol satisfies two of the most important features of a \u201cpublic good\u201d: non-excludability and non-rivalry. - Non-Excludability: Access to Bitcoin\u2019s underlying software is available for anyone to access and use, regardless of whether they contribute to its development or maintenance. Without paying for access, anyone can run a Bitcoin node, own private keys, use the software to send or receive transactions, or contribute to the codebase. - Non-Rivalry: As software, one person\u2019s use of the Bitcoin network does not limit its availability to others. Multiple users can benefit from the software simultaneously. - The Free-Rider Problem: Because of Bitcoin\u2019s non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature, most of its users and beneficiaries are \u201cfree-riders\u201d: they do not contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s software development and maintenance. Bitcoin faces a public goods dilemma: the success and security of the network depend on the work of developers who maintain the codebase, address vulnerabilities, and implement improvements but often are not compensated financially for their efforts. While ideology and/or the desire to contribute to a revolutionary financial technology might motivate them in the short term, Bitcoin developers are unlikely to be sustainable financially over the long term. Compounding the challenge, the Bitcoin network is decentralized, with no central authority or organization responsible for ensuring that developers are compensated adequately. Unlike revenue-generating software companies, Bitcoin relies on a community-driven model funded by voluntary contributions, donations, or grants. Dependent on the goodwill of contributors and other external funding sources, the health, reliability, and security of the Bitcoin network\u2014importantly its developers\u2014are at risk. Without dependable funding, Bitcoin could face risks to its development and security. If only a few entities were to support its development, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization could be compromised as well. We must support and sustain the Bitcoin developer network, not only because it needs us, but because we need it. Toward a Sustainable Funding Mechanism The adoption of Bitcoin by institutions offers an opportunity for investors to rally and solve the public goods dilemma by facilitating sustainable funding for open-source Bitcoin developers. While somewhat helpful, one-time grants or donations may prove unsustainable over the long term. Instead, a concerted effort by various stakeholders to fund developers in perpetuity would support the health and sustainability not only of Bitcoin\u2019s software code but also the first private digital rules-based global monetary system in history and a new asset class. As a Bitcoin stakeholder since 2015, ARK has full conviction in the Bitcoin ecosystem and wants to ensure the sustainability of the open-source developer community. ARK is proud to announce that we are contributing a percentage of the management fees associated with our actively-managed private bitcoin strategies\u2014not a one-off grant\u2014to fund the crucial work of open-source developers and to address the public goods dilemma that has long challenged the open-source community, particularly in the context of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized development model. ARK has selected the three organizations listed below to fund. To learn more, please visit the websites of the following organizations: - Bitcoin Brink - OpenSats - Human Rights Foundation We invite and encourage other institutional funds and stakeholders to join us in this effort. Together, we can build a robust and sustainable foundation that supports the ongoing development of Bitcoin and its broad open-source ecosystem. Case Study: Open-Source Developers Solved Bitcoin\u2019s Inflation Bug Security Vulnerabilities | Also known as CVE-2018-17144, the Bitcoin Inflation Bug was a vulnerability discovered in Bitcoin's code in September 2018. The necessary response to the bug underscores the importance of maintaining a strong developer network. The bug was particularly dangerous: if it had not been solved properly and in a timely manner, the bug could have allowed a malicious actor to issue bitcoin beyond the 21 million limit, inflating its supply and undermining the fundamental economics of the system. The bug was introduced in Bitcoin Core version 0.14.0, released in March 2017, and stemmed from an issue in the consensus code that checks the validity of blocks. Specifically, the bug was related to how Bitcoin nodes handle the validation of duplicate inputs in a transaction. An anonymous developer discovered the inflation bug and reported it to Bitcoin Core's security team, who identified it as a serious vulnerability that could have compromised the entire Bitcoin network. Patching The Inflation Bug The Bitcoin Core Development Team acted swiftly to address the vulnerability. Here's how they moved into action: 1. Immediate Fix: The developers quickly created a patch that fixed the bug. The patch was released as Bitcoin Core version 0.16.3. and ensured that nodes would reject any block containing the malformed transactions that could exploit the vulnerability. 2. Responsible Disclosure: Given the severity of the bug, the Bitcoin Core Development Team initially kept the full details of the vulnerability under wraps. Their primary focus was in getting nodes and miners to update the patched version as quickly as possible, minimizing the risk of exploitation. 3. Coordination with the Ecosystem: The Bitcoin Core Development Team worked closely with other stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including miners and exchanges, to ensure a rapid update to the patched software. Their coordination was crucial in preventing exploitation before most of the network upgraded. 4. Post-Patch Disclosure: Once enough nodes had upgraded and the immediate risk had passed, the Bitcoin Core Development Team disclosed the full details of the bug to the public, including a thorough explanation of how the bug could have been exploited and the steps taken to fix it. | Case Study: Open-Source Developers Initiated The Important Taproot Upgrade | A significant upgrade to the Bitcoin network in 2021, the Taproot upgrade was designed to improve the privacy, efficiency, and flexibility of Bitcoin transactions. Open-source developers carefully activated and coordinated its rollout: 1. Development and Testing: Taproot\u2019s concept and initial code were developed over several years, starting with work on Schnorr signatures. The Bitcoin developer community rigorously tested the code to ensure that it was secure and would work as intended. Developers conducted extensive testing on Bitcoin\u2019s testnet to simulate how Taproot would behave on the main Bitcoin network. 2. BIP Proposals: Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are the formal processes through which changes to Bitcoin are proposed and discussed. Taproot involved several BIPs, including BIP 340 (Schnorr signatures), BIP 341 (Taproot), and BIP 342 (Tapscript). The Bitcoin development community openly discussed those BIPs and incorporated feedback into the final proposals. 3. Signaling and Activation: Taproot was deployed in a process known as Speedy Trial, a signaling mechanism through which miners could include a specific bit in the blocks they mined to signal their readiness to adopt Taproot. The activation required a supermajority of 90% of blocks within a 2,016-block period. The process began in May 2021, and reached the required threshold in June 2021. After hitting the threshold, Taproot was locked until activation in November 2021. 4. Activation: Taproot was officially activated at block 709,632 on November 14, 2021. From that point onward, Taproot\u2019s features became available on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the careful planning and broad support from the Bitcoin developer community, the activation was smooth, with no significant disruptions. | Important Information Bitcoin is a relatively new investment, which has unique and substantial risks and which may be more volatile than other types of investments. Bitcoin operates without central authority or banks and is not backed by any government. Even indirectly, bitcoin may experience very high volatility. Bitcoin is not legal tender. Federal, state or foreign governments could restrict the use and exchange of bitcoin. Bitcoin exchanges could stop operating or permanently shut down due to fraud, technical glitches, hackers or malware.",

    "description": "HRF Bitcoin Development Fund Supports 20+ Projects Worldwide NEW YORK (April 1,2025) \u2014 The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) is pleased to announce 1 billion satoshis of gifts from its Bitcoin Development Fund. HRF\u2019s latest batch of grants supports open-source development, educational initiatives, mining decentralization, and privacy tools for activists living under authoritarian regimes across Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The gifts also further promote Internet freedom and decentralized communications, ensuring dissidents can connect, communicate, organize, and transact without censorship. Quarter 1 2025 grantees include: Authoritarian regimes weaponize Internet shutdowns to silence dissent, restrict information, and cut off financial lifelines. By blocking communication channels, they isolate individuals, suppress independent media, and disrupt financial flows. NetBlocks exposes these digital crackdowns in real time, ensuring the world sees and responds to digital repression. Through continuous monitoring, it equips activists, journalists, and civil society with the data needed to challenge censorship and advocate for an open internet. With HRF support, NetBlocks will expand its monitoring, documentation, and research \u2014 reinforcing internet and financial freedom as a critical human rights safeguard. Authoritarian regimes exploit Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to monitor and suppress dissent, undermining online privacy essential for human rights defenders. TollGate, developed by c03rad0r, is software that transforms any WiFi router into a permissionless Internet Service Provider (ISP) using Bitcoin and ecash. By decentralizing Internet access and turning any WiFi router into part of a peer-to-peer, private, open internet network, Tollgate helps resist authoritarian surveillance and protect digital freedoms. With HRF support, TollGate is advancing an open, accessible, and censorship-proof internet for those who need it most. Across Latin America, authoritarian regimes restrict financial access to tighten their grip on power. But a growing network of developers is working to change that. Vinteum, a nonprofit Bitcoin research and development center led by executive director Lucas Ferreira, trains and funds developers to strengthen Bitcoin as a tool for financial freedom. Through education, development, and community building, Vinteum fosters local talent and expands regional Bitcoin accessibility. With HRF support, Vinteum will scale its programs and help more Latin Americans achieve financial independence. Dictators often block payment processors to cripple the work of nonprofits and dissidents. BTCPay Server, a self-hosted, open-source Bitcoin payment processor, now breaks this control. It provides individuals, nonprofits, and merchants with a censorship-resistant way to accept payments. Activists and nonprofits can now process global payments, launch crowdfunding campaigns, and build movements on Bitcoin \u2014 all without third parties or restrictions. With HRF support, BTCPay Server will expand access to self-custodial payments, enabling more organizations under dictatorships to transact freely. Across Africa, dictators manipulate financial institutions to retain control, while more than half the population remains unbanked. Bitcoin offers an alternative, but without proper research, education, and policy frameworks, adoption remains limited. The Africa Bitcoin Institute (ABI), supported by the Rwandan human rights activist Ana\u00efse Kanimba, is launching to bridge this gap. Through evidence-based research and policy recommendations, ABI will equip policymakers with the knowledge and tools to integrate Bitcoin into African economies. With HRF support, ABI will promote financial autonomy and solidify Bitcoin\u2019s role as a pillar of economic freedom. Running a Bitcoin node (software that enables users to verify transitions and enforce the network\u2019s rules) is key to financial sovereignty. But outdated and clunky interfaces make it difficult, especially on mobile devices. bitcoin-core/gui-qml, a project Go Qu will contribute to, modernizes Bitcoin Core\u2019s interface to be more accessible and mobile-friendly. By lowering the barriers to node operation, this project empowers more people \u2014 especially under autocracies in Africa, where mobile phones dominate \u2014 to strengthen their financial sovereignty. With HRF support, bitcoin-core/gui-qml is expanding node access, supporting Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization, and reinforcing its censorship resistance for the long term. As an open-source project, Bitcoin Core relies on free and open-source developers to maintain its integrity, security, and resilience against potential threats. Rkrux, a Bitcoin Core developer, plays a crucial role by reviewing code, testing releases, and improving documentation to keep Bitcoin Core robust, secure, and censorship-resistant. Rkurx\u2019s work identifies vulnerabilities, refines changes, and strengthens Bitcoin\u2019s long-term stability. With HRF support, Rkrux is deepening his contributions, reinforcing Bitcoin\u2019s foundation, and ensuring it remains a financial lifeline for human rights defenders worldwide. As online censorship intensifies, free speech and financial freedom are under threat. Nostr developer Elsat is working to defend these freedoms by contributing to Damus, Nostrability, and Zap.store \u2014 projects that empower individuals to communicate and transact without centralized control. Damus enables private, censorship-resistant messaging; Nostrability improves app interoperability; and Zap.store helps free and open-source software (FOSS) developers distribute and monetize their work peer-to-peer. With HRF support, Elsat is strengthening tools that protect free speech for dissidents under oppressive environments. Nostr, a decentralized communication protocol, relies on a network of relays (servers that pass messages between users). But setting up relays can be complex and intimidating. Relay Wizard, a tool created by software developer J the Code Monkey, simplifies this process by automating relay setup. This allows anyone to run a relay, reduces reliance on intermediaries, and helps keep nostr resilient against online speech censorship. With HRF support, J the Code Monkey will expand development and operations, ensuring nostr remains a secure, uncensorable communication platform accessible to everyone. Censorship-resistant technology is essential to protecting global freedom. Yet open-source developers often operate like solo entrepreneurs \u2014 juggling engineering, project management, and community-building on their own. This leads to inefficiency, isolation, and burnout. Waye addresses this gap by providing psycho-social support for developers working on freedom tech. Led by Bitcoin Core developer Amiti Uttarwar and operational architect Anna Sides, Waye strengthens the human infrastructure of open source. With HRF support, Waye will support developers from global majority countries, empowering them to build the tools their fellow citizens need. Centralization in Bitcoin mining threatens its censorship resistance and makes it harder for small-scale miners to compete. Hashpool, a self-hosted mining pool by developer vnprc, eliminates reliance on centralized entities while giving miners more control over their earnings. Instead of traditional mining pool payouts, Hashpool rewards participants with ecash tokens \u2014 digital cash that enables instant, private transactions. This ensures miners receive payouts instantly while preserving their financial privacy. It also helps keep mining open and decentralized. With HRF support, vnprc will further develop Hashpool and help resist mining centralization. As dictators ramp up financial surveillance to threaten dissidents, protecting financial privacy is more critical than ever. Cashu KVAC is a software upgrade for Cashu \u2014 a Chaumian ecash-based system that enables extremely strong financial privacy. Developed by lollerfirst, it improves privacy and efficiency by reducing wallet data storage and concealing transaction amounts from third parties. These improvements strengthen ecash functionality, safeguarding financial privacy for individuals and nonprofits alike. With HRF support, lollerfirst will develop Cashu KVAC and help protect digital and financial freedom for those living under the watchful eyes of dictators. In unstable economies and under authoritarian regimes, self-custodial Bitcoin is a financial lifeline \u2014 portable money that cannot be seized, censored, or debased. While Bitcoin enables financial freedom, scaling self-custody remains a challenge. Bitcoin educator and developer Brandon Black (Rearden) is researching these limitations and exploring technical solutions to make self-custody more accessible. His work documents the obstacles users face today and provides insights into how Bitcoin can evolve. With HRF support, Black will expand self-custody education, equipping individuals under dictatorships with the knowledge and tools to secure their financial independence. For citizens living under authoritarian regimes and struggling economies, Bitcoin is a lifeline \u2014 but its volatility can threaten short-term financial security. Stable Channels, created by software engineer Tony Klausing, brings stabilized Bitcoin-backed balances to the Lightning Network (allowing users to peg Bitcoin to fiat currencies in a self-custodial way). This innovation enables individuals to transact freely without exposure to wild price swings or to centralized stablecoins. HRF\u2019s support will help expand Stable Channels development, ecash integrations, and community outreach \u2014 helping more individuals harness Bitcoin\u2019s power while maintaining financial stability. In Kenya, Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) provide savings and lending services to their communities. But reliance on traditional banks limits their autonomy. Bitsacco, created by developer okjodom, reinvents SACCOs by leveraging Bitcoin and Fedimints (a community-based custody model in Bitcoin). In this way, Bitsacco offers a more open, inclusive, and self-sustaining financial option. By reducing dependence on banks, Bitsacco empowers communities to manage their savings and loans independently. With HRF support, Bitsacco will provide a secure, familiar path to sound money in a region where financial instability and restricted access are persistent challenges. In Africa, where financial literacy gaps persist, hands-on Bitcoin education is crucial for adoption. The Core, founded by Kenyan Bitcoin educator Felix Mukungu, bridges this gap by equipping Africans with the knowledge and skills to use Bitcoin confidently. Through hands-on training in self-custody, Lightning wallets, and Bitcoin nodes, The Core empowers individuals to take control of their money and transact freely. This grant will help expand The Core\u2019s monthly meetups, online courses, and student-support programs \u2014 bringing Bitcoin education to more individuals across Kenya and the wider African continent. Under many authoritarian regimes, infant malnutrition is exacerbated and puts countless children at risk. Bitcoin Babies, founded by Naomi Wambui, is a project that tackles this issue by combining infant nutrition education with Bitcoin-based financial literacy. Through weekly Bitcoin stipends, financial literacy training, and community support, mothers under authoritarian rule gain the tools needed to improve their children\u2019s health while achieving long-term financial stability. With this grant, Bitcoin Babies will expand its impact, helping more at-risk communities with resources that are otherwise unavailable and inaccessible, empowering mothers to build brighter futures. In East Asia, language barriers and limited mentorship have made open-source Bitcoin development inaccessible to many. The East Asia Bitcoin Developer Apprenticeship Program, led by Bitcoin developer Calvin Kim, is changing that by creating a pathway for Korean and Japanese developers to enter the field. Through hands-on training, mentees gain practical experience, contribute to open-source projects, and eventually become mentors \u2014 strengthening the region\u2019s developer ecosystem. With this funding, the apprenticeship program will expand, diversify Bitcoin\u2019s global developer base, make freedom technology more accessible across Asia, and forge links with North Korean defectors. Across Latin America, government overreach threatens financial freedom. At TalentLand 2025, Latin America\u2019s largest tech event, Bitcoin Week will demonstrate how Bitcoin empowers individuals to reclaim their financial sovereignty. Led by developer Super Testnet and the Bitcoin and Lightning Guadalajara community, this initiative educates Mexico\u2019s tech community on Bitcoin\u2019s role in fostering financial sovereignty. Through workshops, hackathons, and debates, it nurtures developer talent and engages future tech leaders. With this funding, Bitcoin Week will help expand awareness of Bitcoin\u2019s power to resist financial oppression and accelerate Bitcoin adoption across Latin America. Learning Bitcoin\u2019s technical aspects can feel overwhelming. Base58\u2019s Bitcoin Live Action Role Play (LARP) simplifies this with a two-hour workshop where participants act out the Bitcoin network and see how transactions are made, how they get to miners, the work a Bitcoin node does, and how it helps secure the network. Created by Lisa Neigut (niftynei), a prolific Bitcoin developer, educator, and founder of Base58 and the bitcoin++ conference, alongside David Rodriguez, this immersive experience makes Bitcoin education tangible and entertaining. Now expanding beyond North America, it will train new facilitators, prioritizing regions with limited Bitcoin education due to authoritarian restrictions. With this funding, Base58 Bitcoin LARP will equip more facilitators to teach and learn Bitcoin in an engaging, accessible way. Across Latin America, financial repression and limited access to Bitcoin education leave many without the tools to navigate financial repression. BTCenEspa\u00f1ol has been a leader in Spanish-language Bitcoin education since 2014. With a goal of reaching one million learners and training 100 teachers, BTCenEspa\u00f1ol is expanding to make Bitcoin education more accessible across the region, especially in places like Nicaragua and Venezuela. HRF\u2019s grant will support this growth, equipping individuals with the knowledge to secure their financial independence amid rising authoritarianism in the continent. Under dictatorships, non-governmental organizations face frozen bank accounts, surveillance, and financial censorship \u2014 limiting their ability to support vulnerable communities. Bitcoin researcher Daniel Batten is quantifying Bitcoin\u2019s role as a financial lifeline to help nonprofits overcome these challenges. Through empirical research, his initiative will show how Bitcoin enables nonprofits under authoritarian regimes to operate more freely. With this grant, the project will equip nonprofits in closed societies with the knowledge and tools to integrate Bitcoin into their operations, strengthening their financial resilience and advancing global movements. When authoritarian regimes weaponize the financial system against dissent, nonprofits and charities are among the first to suffer. Bitcoin for Good is an educational initiative led by activist and Groundswell founder Hadiya Masieh. It helps organizations break free by teaching them how to accept and manage censorship-resistant funding. Through hands-on training and direct integration with Bitcoin for donations, nonprofits learn to operate outside the reach of financial gatekeepers and regimes. With this grant, Bitcoin for Good will help nonprofits stay funded, independent, and free to continue their work.

Brink administers several programs aimed at providing financial support to developers and researchers working on Bitcoin. Its Brink Fellowship program introduces exceptional developers from other fields to the world of Bitcoin development, while the Grants program supports existing Bitcoin Core contributors. Nexo\u2019s donation of $150,000 matches or exceeds previous commitments to Brink by Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square, Gemini, Kraken and the Human Rights Foundation. The funds will be deployed later in the month to support an independent Bitcoin developer through the Grants program. \u201cThe $150,000 donation to Brink marks Nexo\u2019s commitment to open-source funding and supporting Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency that spawned a trillion-dollar industry,\u201d said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo. Commenting on the current landscape of cryptocurrency businesses, he continued: \u201cThere are surprisingly few crypto businesses who give back to the Bitcoin community by supporting development work. Mostly, it\u2019s exchanges, and even then, we\u2019re missing some really big names. We\u2019re proud to be part of such an exclusive club, but we also believe the industry should do more. What if some of the public companies that recently started allocating billions to BTC also put a small percentage of that, say 0.25%, in support of Bitcoin development?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that another major industry player is supporting open source development,\u201d added John Newbery, co-founder and executive director of Brink. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s security depends on the experience and dedication of open-source protocol developers. Brink was built with the exact purpose of helping individuals and companies support independent Bitcoin development, and we always welcome more contributions to this cause.\u201d About Nexo Nexo is the world\u2019s leading regulated financial institution for digital assets, with $5 billion in assets under management. The company\u2019s mission is to maximize the value and utility of cryptocurrencies by offering tax-efficient Instant Crypto Credit Lines\u2122, a high-yield Earn on Crypto & Fiat suite, and sophisticated trading and OTC capabilities, while providing top-tier custodial insurance and military-grade security for the Nexo Wallet.

    "description": "The funding rate mechanism: long hailed as one of crypto\u2019s most pivotal innovations. It propelled bull runs, refined trading costs, and effectively stabilised market movements through efficient arbitrage. However, as market cycles continue to unfold, are funding rates now signaling a shift in market behaviour? Pioneered by BitMEX in 2016, XBTUSD is the longest-running Bitcoin perpetual swap, widely used by some of the most sea-soned traders in the crypto industry. This piece provides an in-depth analysis of nearly 9 years of funding rate data from BitMEX\u2019s XBTUSD perpetual swap, covering the period from May 2016 to May 2025. Our comprehensive statistical review reveals XBTUSD\u2019s significant market evolution \u2014 having started from consistent volatility to now, institutional-grade stability \u2014 highlighted by remarkably subdued funding rates during the 2024-2025 bull market. Let\u2019s dive in. What are Perpetual Swaps and Funding Rates? BitMEX\u2019s invention of perpetual swaps changed the game for crypto trading \u2013 perpetual swaps are now foundational instruments in crypto derivatives and stand as one of the most commonly traded financial products to this day. A core component of perpetual swaps is the employment of funding rates, which act as a tool to maintain the alignment between a token\u2019s swap price and spot price. Due to its long-standing history, BitMEX\u2019s XBTUSD contract, launched in May 2016, provides the richest dataset of Bitcoin perpetual funding rates. Funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short position holders of a perpetual swap contract. When a perpetual contract has a positive funding rate, this means long position holders pay short position holders, and vice versa. Positive funding rates indicate a bullish market, while negative rates suggest a bearish one. Funding rates are crucial for arbitrage opportunities and market sentiment. This piece dives into the analysis of funding rate patterns of XBTUSD over the past 9 years. Our key findings demonstrate a distinct shift of XBTUSD from previously high volatility towards unprecedented stability, even amidst Bitcoin reaching all-time highs exceeding $100,000 during the 2024-2025 market cycle. Nine Years of Funding Rates Evolution: From Chaos to Stability The funding rate market for XBTUSD has progressively shown remarkable stabilisation, with extreme funding rates dropping by 90% compared to historical levels. Funding rates now consistently cluster around minimum levels and are quickly normalised through automated arbitrage activities. Most notably, the annualised volatility has compressed dramatically to a \u00b110% range, a level of stability never seen before in Bitcoin derivatives history. The transformation, which took place over nearly a decade, can be broken down into three distinct phases that shaped today\u2019s funding rate landscape: Phase 1: The Wild West Era (2016-2018) Throughout the first 2 years of its debut (2016-2018), data reveals a funding rate market characterised by extreme inefficiency and spectacular volatility. Figure 1 shows the dramatic contrast between XBTUSD\u2019s early and current funding rate behaviour: - Funding rates regularly exceeded \u00b10.3%, equivalent to annualised rates of over \u00b11000%. - The 2017 bull run featured the highest concentration of extreme events in Bitcoin\u2019s history. - 2017 alone recorded over 250 extreme funding events, representing nearly daily occurrences of market inefficiency. - Extreme funding periods lasted 6-8+ intervals (2-3 days), indicating sustained market inefficiencies. Phase 2: Gradual Maturation (2018-2024) During the period of 2018-2024, the XBTUSD funding rate market began correcting itself: - Extreme events annually reduced significantly from over 250 in 2017 to approximately 130 by 2019. - Distribution of funding rates gradually compressed toward normal ranges. - Key market shocks like COVID-19, the LUNA and FTX collapses triggered notable volatility, albeit less frequently. Phase 3: Giants Enter the Game (2024-Present) Two critical developments in early 2024 redefined the market landscape: January 2024: Bitcoin ETF Launch - Institutional arbitrage interests surged as spot ETFs enabled large-scale cash-and-carry trades. - ETFs anchored swap prices closer to spot prices, compressing funding rates and eliminating significant arbitrage gaps. February 2024: Ethena Protocol Launch - Ethena introduced systematic funding rate arbitrage through synthetic stablecoins, achieving substantial adoption (over $4 billion TVL). - Democratised arbitrage was introduced (previously dominated by institutions) and became accessible to everyday retail participants, further stabilising rates. The Funding Rate Arbitrage Strategy: Did it Work? Understanding this evolution is probably only fascinating from an academic perspective, but traders care about one thing and one thing only: profits. What were the historical returns for BitMEX traders who engaged in funding rate arbitrage strategies? To answer this, we conducted a comprehensive backtest analysis spanning the entire 9-year history of XBTUSD funding rate data. The results uncovered a mind-blowing fact about Bitcoin funding rates: a simple $100,000 investment in funding rate arbitrage in 2016 would have turned into $8 million today. Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative profit comparison between funding rate arbitrage (green) and simple Bitcoin buy-and-hold (orange) from 2016 to present. While the market is often busy chasing Bitcoin\u2019s drastic price swings, the opportunity that lay with funding rate arbitrage would have returned one of the best risk/reward profits. The strategy provided an extraordinary 873% annualised return, with a perfect track record\u2014no losing years, no major drawdowns, just consistent profit accumulation that turned a modest six-figure investment into generational wealth. BitMEX\u2019s Bitcoin Payment Multiplier Effect For XBTUSD, BitMEX pays funding rates in Bitcoin rather than USD stablecoins, which creates a wealth multiplier opportunity for arbitrageurs. Any funding payments received at $500 Bitcoin in 2016 have 200x more after Bitcoin hit $100,000 in 2024. Had BitMEX paid funding in USDT like other exchanges, the $8 million profit would have been closer to $800,000 \u2013 still impressive, but falling short of the Bitcoin payments which created a compounding effect that turned funding arbitrage into one of crypto\u2019s most lucrative historical strategies. Figure 3 breaks down the risk-adjusted metrics that reveal why funding rate arbitrage achieved such impressive results. Out of the 9,941 funding periods, XBTUSD had a positive funding rate 71.4% of the time, meaning roughly 3 out of every 4 funding periods were profitable. While these historical returns paint an almost too-good-to-be-true picture, experienced traders know that past performance rarely predicts future results \u2013 especially when market structure undergoes fundamental changes. This paints a good picture for the current state of funding rates. Many are noticing that its outsized opportunities appear to be vanishing. Despite Bitcoin having shattered its all-time highs in 2024, funding rates refused to spike. Given market developments and Bitcoin\u2019s increased establishment, the lack of high funding rates is creating a critical question for basis traders, yield farmers, and Ethena YT/sUSDe holders: Are funding rates a thing of the past? The Funding Squeeze: Are the Glory Days Over? Previous Bull Market Performance: - 2017 Bull Run: Funding rates regularly exceeded 0.2%, with peaks above 0.3% - 2021 First Peak: Sustained rates around 0.2-0.3% for weeks - 2021 Second Peak: Still hitting 0.07-0.1% during rallies 2024\u2019s Disappointing Reality - Maximum Rate: 0.1308% (less than half of previous bull markets) - Sustained High Rates: Virtually non-existent - Mean Rate: 0.0173% (despite Bitcoin prices reaching $70k+) Figure 4 clearly visualises this transformation \u2013 how the majority of funding rates now cluster tightly around the zero line with far fewer extreme outliers compared to historical periods. This has left arbitrage traders questioning their future profitability or yield-generating protocols wondering if the \u201cfunding rate alpha\u201d has been permanently stored away. So what could explain this behaviour? Two leading theories attempt to explain why the funding rate goldmine appears to be drying up: Theory 1: The Institutional Invasion - Massive institutional and DeFi arbitrage capital swiftly neutralises funding deviations. - ETF launches and protocols like Ethena are rapidly correcting funding anomalies, causing market saturation and rapid reversion to neutral funding rates. Theory 2: The Efficiency Revolution - Market structure has permanently evolved towards institutional-grade efficiency. - Improved market depth, liquidity, and cross-market arbitrage have eliminated persistent extreme events. The Current State of Funding Rates: What the Data Reveals Before declaring funding arbitrage as dead, our analysis uncovered three interesting findings: Finding 1: High Funding Rates Become Short-Lived 2024 vs. 2021 Bull Market Comparison at $53,000 Bitcoin: High funding rates still occur, but they\u2019re shorter-lived and more predictable. The opportunity hasn\u2019t disappeared\u2014it\u2019s evolved. Finding 2: Funding Rate Opportunities Still Exist Post-ETFs Contrary to the \u201csaturation\u201d theory, Bitcoin\u2019s ETF approval actually increased funding rates for the first 3 months, showing funding rates can be still persistent amid more institutional arbitrage. - Pre-ETF Period: October 2023 \u2013 January 2024 (0.011% average) - Post-ETF Period: January 2024 \u2013 March 2024 (0.018% average) - Net Impact: +69% increase in funding rates Institutional adoption creates systematic demand imbalances that generate consistent, if smaller, arbitrage opportunities. Finding 3: Persistently Positive Funding Rates As indicated in Figure 5, funding rates have been persistently positive despite increasing institutional participation and the introduction of major basis trading opportunities like Bitcoin ETFs and DeFi protocols. This suggests that the market has found a new equilibrium \u2013 one where consistently positive funding rates coexist with sophisticated arbitrage activity. While the magnitude of these rates is more modest compared to previous cycles, their stability and persistence demonstrate the market\u2019s acceptance of this new normal. The Bottom Line: Evolution, Not Extinction After nearly a decade of maturation, Bitcoin funding rates have evolved from speculative volatility to stable, institutional-grade market conditions. The data from XBTUSD funding rates from 2024 onward clearly demonstrates that the crypto derivatives market has transitioned from a speculative playground to a systematically efficient financial ecosystem. This evolution, driven by ETF-enabled institutional arbitrage and DeFi-native systematic funding rate arbitrage protocols like Ethena, signifies a fundamental milestone. Bitcoin derivatives markets have now fully integrated into mainstream finance, marking the definitive end of crypto\u2019s Wild West era and the beginning of institutional sophistication and stability.

Calvin has received a US$100,000 grant from the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), which was announced on 9 May 2023. Therefore the funding of Calvin\u2019s research and development work on Bitcoin and Utreexo will continue. The presence of other funders, like the HRF, to step up and support Calvin, illustrates the much richer and more vibrant developer funding environment for Bitcoin which exists today, compared to the 2019/20 period when BitMEX launched the open source developer funding program. BitMEX would like to thank Calvin for his exceptional work over the years and we wish him all the best of luck going forwards. Calvin said: I\u2019m extremely grateful for BitMEX\u2019s support over the past 3 years. The support they gave me allowed me to freely research improvements to the Utreexo algorithms and as well as allowing me to research how to best integrate it to the existing Bitcoin protocol. The steady support that BitMEX provided allowed me to grow as a Bitcoin developer and helped me contribute meaningful research to the Bitcoin ecosystem. I\u2019m excited to continue my work with HRF\u2019s support and will continue in my quest to bring Utreexo and all its benefits to all users. Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the HRF said: The Human Rights Foundation is delighted to support Calvin and his work to strengthen the decentralisation, censorship-resistance, and scaling potential of the Bitcoin network. While on the BitMEX program, Calvin produced some excellent blog posts explaining how Utreexo works, with some informative diagrams. Most notably his May 2021 piece entitled \u201cOut of Order Block Validation with Utreexo Accumulators\u201d.",

This is the fourth consecutive time BitMEX has provided Chris a grant, over a three year period. Chris is working on StratumV2. StratumV2 is a new protocol for pooled Bitcoin mining, which can allow miners to select transactions rather than the pool operator. This improves Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance properties. In addition to this, the new protocol helps with securing the communication and improving efficiency of the mining pool. Alongside BitMEX, other organisations financing the development of StratumV2 include Spiral, the Human Rights Foundation, Galaxy DIgital and Foundry Digital. You can find out more about StratumV2 here. Commenting on the grant, Chris said: I\u2019d like to thank BitMEX for the continued support on funding open source software and Bitcoin development. This round of the grant will allow me to continue supporting efforts and development of the Stratum V2 protocol, as well as integrating Stratum V2 into Bitcoin.

    "description": "Abstract: A few weeks ago, we published a piece on Bitcoin Cash and how one can analyse transaction data on the two blockchains involved in the split to draw conclusions about the potential investment flows between the two chains. Here is a similar analysis of Bitcoin Gold. Please click here to download the pdf version of this report Bitcoin Gold overview Bitcoin Gold (the BTG token) is a Bitcoin chainsplit token, similar to Bitcoin Cash. Anyone who held Bitcoin on block 491,406 (which occurred 24 October 2017) was allocated an identical amount of Bitcoin Gold. Some exchanges allowed customers to trade their Bitcoin Gold from this date based on customer balances at the time of the fork. However, the Bitcoin Gold blockchain itself did not appear to become usable until 14 November 2017, 21 days after the snapshot point. Bitcoin Gold appears to aim to improve mining centralisation by switching the hashing algorithm from SHA256 to Equihash, which is currently more GPU-friendly than the ASIC-dominated SHA256. Allocation of BTG to coin founders Although the Bitcoin Gold project team does not always appear to want to make this fact well known, 100,000 coins were created then allocated to the team members. This consists of the block reward for 8,000 blocks, which with a block reward of 12.5 BTG amounts to 100,000 coins. Based on the current spot price of BTG of US$450 per coin, this balance is worth approximately US$45 million. In the eyes of many, this seemingly unnecessary allocation is likely to damage the integrity of Bitcoin Gold. Bitcoin Cash, for example, did not have such an allocation. One could argue that Bitcoin Cash\u2019s initial difficulty-adjustment mechanism also allowed an unusually large number of coins to be created in the initial period following the fork, although this seems somewhat fairer than what Bitcoin Gold did, as anyone could have mined the Bitcoin Cash tokens and they were not directly allocated. Total coins spent As of 20 December 2017, 2.61 million BTG have been spent at least once. In comparison, 4.7 million BTC have been spent since the snapshot point and 2.4 million BTC have been spent since Bitcoin Gold transactions became possible. Similarly, 4.1 million Bitcoin Cash was spent over an equivalent number of days following that token\u2019s fork point. The 2.61 million BTG that has been spent represents about 15.8% of all BTG. This is likely related to the level of divestment from Bitcoin Gold, mainly because this 2.61 million BTG is higher than a comparable first-time spend in Bitcoin over the same period. Millions of coins of Bitcoin Gold (BTG) and Bitcoin (BTC) spent at least once since the chain split compared to the BTG price. (Source: BitMEX research, Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin Gold blockchain, Bitfinex price data) Daily Bitcoin Gold spend for the first time The average daily spend for the first time on Bitcoin Gold is falling slightly, compared to the initial period after the launch. In the last 10 days, the average daily spend for the first time was 44,000, compared to around 110,000 in the first 10 days. Bitcoin Gold spent for the first time since the split (in daily millions) compared to the BTG price (Source: BitMEX research, Bitcoin Gold blockchain, Bitfinex price data) Security incident The official Bitcoin Gold GitHub repository may have been hacked for 4.5 days from 21 November to 25 November 2017, when the official website pointed to a malicious wallet. According to an announcement from the Bitcoin Gold team, the hacked wallet allowed the malicious entity to access funds sent to new Bitcoin Gold addresses provided by the wallet. Bitcoin was not affected as existing private keys were not compromised. It is not clear exactly what happened, but the Bitcoin Gold team claims that at least 80 BTG were stolen. Given the severity of this incident, the impact could have been far worse. This incident illustrates why it\u2019s important to handle these new fork tokens with caution. In particular, we would strongly advise you not to import your Bitcoin private key into these new fork token wallets without first spending the Bitcoin to a new output associated with a different private key after the token snapshot point, so that your Bitcoin is not at risk.",

Besides allowing me to work on Bitcoin Core and related education projects full time through the grant program, Brink has gone through significant lengths in enabling developers from across the world to meet and work with each other in-person, whether on a permanent or ad-hoc basis.\" Fabian Jahr Fabian's grant supports his work on investigating innovations enabled by Schnorr signatures, dedicated in-depth code review of important Bitcoin Core initiatives, ASMap development, and alternative code hosting solutions. \"A full-time grant enables me to concentrate on thoroughly reviewing intricate proposals and code modifications, allowing me to grasp their full implications and potential impact on the network.\" Eugene Siegel Eugene's grant supports his security engineering work including fuzz testing, code review, and building out fuzzing infrastructure, with a focus on the P2P networking code. \"I think Bitcoin Core is leading the way in fuzzing in the industry, and I hope to contribute to its role as a model for other projects looking to apply fuzzing techniques effectively in their own domains.\" Brink Fellows Marco De Leon Marco De Leon is a Brink fellow mentored by Niklas G\u00f6gge. His focus is on Bitcoin Core fuzz testing, with the goal of expanding test coverage, adding useful oracles, and identifying vulnerabilities. \"I\u2019m excited and thankful for the opportunity from Brink to learn about Bitcoin this next year. And shoutout to Niklas, who\u2019s been awesome so far, for being willing to mentor me during the fellowship.\" FAQ How is Brink funded?

    "description": "It\u2019s an exciting new chapter for Bitcoin finance: we are proud to announce the launch of Blockstream Asset Management (BAM) and two accompanying Bitcoin-based investment funds opening in Q1 2025: the Blockstream Income Fund and the Blockstream Alpha Fund. These funds are specifically designed for institutions and accredited investors looking for transparent, regulated, and secure ways to invest in Bitcoin. A third fund, the Blockstream Yield Fund, is also slated for release later this year, providing Bitcoin holders with consistent, low-risk returns. Bridging Bitcoin and Traditional Finance With the launch of BAM, we are taking another step toward establishing Bitcoin as a core component of modern investment portfolios. \u201cThe launch of Blockstream Asset Management and our inaugural suite of investment funds represents Bitcoin\u2019s evolution from a niche asset into a pillar of modern investment portfolios. With these funds, we\u2019re providing a previously unavailable\u2014but long sought after\u2014way for institutional and high-net-worth investors to access the Bitcoin ecosystem. Combining the asset\u2019s unique potential with the transparency, security, and innovation synonymous with Blockstream, this launch marks a key step in our mission to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream finance and drive global adoption.\u201d BAM\u2019s new funds are offered under the 506(c) exemption and cater to institutions and accredited investors seeking innovative performance-driven opportunities in Bitcoin. Blockstream Income Fund: Stable, Predictable Returns The Blockstream Income Fund is a USD yield fund built to generate stable, predictable income. How does it work? - By lending against Bitcoin collateral with conservative loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, the fund maintains robust collateralization and sound risk management. - Target yields range from high single digits to low-teens in percentage terms. - Focuses on loans between $100,000 and $5 million, a segment often overlooked by traditional lenders. - Leverages Blockstream\u2019s network of Bitcoin-native startups and businesses, ensuring a strong pipeline of high-quality borrowers. This approach helps democratize access to capital, addresses pricing inefficiencies for Bitcoin-backed loans, and taps into Bitcoin\u2019s best attributes\u201424/7 liquidity and efficient settlement. Blockstream Alpha Fund: Strategically Enhanced Returns For investors seeking more active strategies, the Blockstream Alpha Fund delivers risk-adjusted outperformance within the Bitcoin ecosystem by combining: - Diversified trading strategies (derivatives trading, event-driven opportunities, basis trading). - Infrastructure-based revenue streams, such as Lightning Network node operations. With a dynamic balance of risk and return, the Alpha Fund is ideal for institutions and sophisticated investors wanting to anchor or complement an existing digital assets allocation. The fund\u2019s integrated approach not only seeks to produce stable returns - it also contributes to the ongoing development of the broader Bitcoin economy. Led by Industry Veterans The creation of BAM is the result of months of planning by Dr. Adam Back and Sean Bill, Blockstream\u2019s Chief Investment Officer. Sean joined Blockstream in November 2024 and has nearly three decades of experience in institutional portfolio and risk management. A strong proponent of Bitcoin adoption in the pensions industry, Sean was instrumental in shaping BAM\u2019s product offerings. A Broader Institutional Strategy BAM\u2019s launch follows key milestones that underscore Blockstream\u2019s drive to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and traditional finance: - A $210 million convertible note financing round led by Fulgur Ventures. - A $75 million strategic investment by Blockstream Capital Partners into Komainu\u2014an institutional digital asset custodian backed by Nomura\u2019s Laser Digital. - Ongoing work to integrate best-in-class Blockstream technologies like the Liquid Network and the Asset Management Platform (AMP) with Komainu\u2019s custody solutions. These efforts align with Blockstream\u2019s commitment to bringing regulated, enterprise-grade solutions to market, setting new standards for how Bitcoin can be integrated into traditional finance. Learn More Blockstream Asset Management\u2019s debut marks a new era for Bitcoin\u2019s role in global finance, offering robust, secure, and innovative investment vehicles for a wide range of participants.
