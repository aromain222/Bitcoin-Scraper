  - Step-by-step UFCF calculation: EBIT → NOPAT → +D&A → -CapEx → -ΔNWC
  - Mid-year convention discount factors: `1/(1+WACC)^(t-0.5)`
  - Terminal value calculations using both methods:
    - Perpetuity Growth: `TV = UFCF(n+1) / (WACC - g)`
    - Exit Multiple: `TV = EBITDA(n) × Exit Multiple`
  - Present value calculations with audit trail

### 4. DCF Valuation
- **Purpose**: Core valuation model with enterprise to equity bridge
- **Key Features**:

  - Balance Sheet summary (cash, debt, net debt)
  - Key ratios: EBITDA margin, EBIT margin, FCF margin, FCF yield

### 7. Audit Checks (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Model integrity validation and calculation verification
- **Key Features**:
  - **Model Integrity Checks**:
    - Terminal growth < WACC validation
    - Terminal value as % of enterprise value check
    - All FCFs positive validation
    - WACC reasonable range check
  - **Calculation Verification**:
    - Enterprise value calculation audit
    - Equity value bridge verification
    - Share price calculation check
  - **Sensitivity Sanity Checks**:
    - Base case reasonableness
    - Upside/downside scenario validation
  - **Assumptions Validation**:
    - Industry benchmark comparison
    - Color-coded status indicators (✅ PASS, ⚠️ WARNING, ❌ FAIL)

## 🧮 Precise and Dynamic Calculations

### UFCF Formula
```
UFCF = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - CapEx - ΔNWC
```

### Discount Factor (Mid-Year Convention)
```
DF(t) = 1 / (1 + WACC)^(t - 0.5)
```

### Terminal Value (Perpetuity Growth)
```
TV = UFCF(n+1) / (WACC - g)
```

### Terminal Value (Exit Multiple)
```
TV = EBITDA(n) × Exit Multiple
```

### Enterprise to Equity Bridge
```
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt + Non-Operating Assets - Preferred Equity ± Other Adjustments
```
